# phd-thesis-uoe
An unofficial thesis template from a University of Exeter doctoral researcher.

I created a template that follows University of Exeter guidelines on text formatting, and also followed the APA guidelines in bibliography.
Please note that you would need to compile the document with LuaTex to get the same result (some of the packages, e.g. Arial font, are not compatible with LaTex)

Thanks for checking this out.
